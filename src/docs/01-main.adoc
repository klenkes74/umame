== Overview and architecture

=== Scope of UMAME

UMAME tries to solve the problems for resource server(((Resource Server)))(((, Resource Server)))s.
It is directed to JAX-RS resources that should be protected on resource level with user managed access.
There will be support for (un)registering resources at the authorization server(((Authorization Server))) (((, Authorization Server))), but the management of the permissions ins out of scope.
You will need some software to allow that management.
The used reference implementation ((Keycloak))footnote:keycloak[https://www.keycloak.org[Keycloak] is an open source project
mainly developed by https://www.redhat.com[Red Hat].
Red Hat also offers a supported product Red Hat SSO based on Keycloak.
For full disclosure: I work for Red Hat.]

For UMAME, the client and resource server(((Resource Server)))(((Resource Server))) are one identity.
The sequence diagrams separated between them to show the (((Requesting Resource)))UMA request resource flow in a more recognizable manner.

=== Sequence flows of this software

The following flows are implemented in the library.

==== Requesting a resource (w/ token)

.(((Requesting Resource, w/ token)))Requesting a resource w/ token.
[#uma-flow-resource-with-token]
image::generated/01-uma-flow-access-with-token.seqdiag.png[width="200%"]
The flow is easy, as soon as the client owns a token to request access.
The token is checked at the introspection endpoint of the authorization server(((Authorization Server)))(((Authorization Server))).

==== Requesting a resource (w/o token)

.(((, Requesting Resource, w/o token)))Requesting a resource w/o token.
[#uma-flow-resource-without-token]
image::generated/01-uma-flow-access.seqdiag.png[width="200%"]
When no token is transmitted during the request, the flow is quite complicated to retrieve the token.
As soon as the token is presented, the flow in <<Requesting a resource (w/ token)>> is taking over.

==== Registering a resource (w/o authz code)

.(((, Register Resource)))Registering a new resource w/o authz code.
[#uma-flow-register-resource]
image::generated/01-uma-register-resource.seqdiag.png[with="200%"]
The resource needs to be registered at the authorization server(((Authorization Server))) (((, Authorization Server))) to be accessible.
The permission management will be handled out-of-band from UMAMEs point of view.
