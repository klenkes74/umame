== Overview and architecture

=== Scope of UMAME
UMAME tries to solve the problems for Resource Servers. It is directed to JAX-RS resources that should be protected on
resource level with user managed access. There will be support for (un)registering resources at the Authorization Server,
but the management of the permissions ins out of scope. You will need some software to allow that management. The used
reference implementation ((Keycloak))footnote:keycloak[https://www.keycloak.org[Keycloak] is an open source project
mainly developed by https://www.redhat.com[Red Hat]. Red Hat also offers a supported product Red Hat SSO based on
Keycloak. For full disclosure: I work for Red Hat.]

For UMAME, the client and Resource Server are one identity. The sequence diagrams seperated between them to show the
(((UMA flow, Requesting Resource)))UMA request resource flow in a more recognizable manner.

=== Sequence flows of this software
The following (((UMA flow)))flows are implemented in the library.

==== Requesting a resource (w/ token)
.(((UMA flow, Requesting Resource, w/ token)))Requesting a resource w/ token.
[#uma-flow-resource-with-token]
image::generated/01-uma-flow-access-with-token.seqdiag.png[width="200%"]
The flow is easy, as soon as the client owns a token to request access. The token is checked at the introspection
endpoint of the Authorization Server.

==== Requesting a resource (w/o token)
.(((UMA flow, Requesting Resource, w/o token)))Requesting a resource w/o token.
[#uma-flow-resource-without-token]
image::generated/01-uma-flow-access.seqdiag.png[width="200%"]
When no token is transmitted during the request, the flow is quite complicted to retrieve the
token. As soon as the token is presented, the flow in <<Requesting a resource (w/ token)>> is taking over.

==== Registering a resource (w/o authz code)
.(((UMA flow, Register Resource)))Registering a new resource w/o authz code.
[#uma-flow-register-resource]
image::generated/01-uma-register-resource.seqdiag.png[with="200%"]
The resource needs to be registered at the Authorization Server to be accessable. The permission management will be
handled out-of-band from UMAMEs point of view.
